    I am working as a Post-doctoral fellow at the Indian Institute of Madras. As an Infrared Thermography NDT group lead, I work in the development of quantitative models and developing experimental schemes for utilizing infrared frequencies for flaw detection, imaging, and material characterization.
  
    I am also working towards building my first deep-tech venture Spectracops. I started doing this as Founder in Residence at Entrepreneur First, an incubator-cum-accelerator. We explored several interesting technological solutions, exploring the market, validating the technology, speaking to customers, and researching prototypes.

    I graduated from University of Montpellier-II's Mechanics and Civil Engineering PhD program where I completed my thesis work in Laboratory of Mechanics and Civil Engineering (LMGC) under the guidance of Prof. Gilles Fras, Dr. Sebastien Rouquette and Dr. Fabien Soulie. Before joining UM2, I received the Master of science by research degree in Mechanical engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Previously, I received AMIE in Mechanical Engineering from Institution of Engineers (India).

    My quantitative, data-driven approach to complex problems is guided by my diverse experience in a wide variety of science and engineering domains. I approach every challenge I take on with a collaborative, analytical, and pragmatic strategy and drive projects to successful completion.
